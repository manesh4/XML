XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.

XML was designed to store and transport data.

XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.

It has sender information
It has receiver information
It has a heading
It has a message body

XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

The tags in the example above (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" 
by the author of the XML document.

HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.

With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.

XML is Extensible
Most XML applications will work as expected even if new data is added (or removed).

Imagine an application designed to display the original version of note.xml (<to> <from> <heading> <body>).

Then imagine a newer version of note.xml with added <date> and <hour> elements, and a removed <heading>.

XML Simplifies Things
XML simplifies data sharing
XML simplifies data transport
XML simplifies platform changes
XML simplifies data availability
Many computer systems contain data in incompatible formats. Exchanging data between incompatible systems 
(or upgraded systems) is a time-consuming task for web developers. Large amounts of data must be converted, 
and incompatible data is often lost.

XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing,
 transporting, and sharing data.

XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers,
 without losing data.

With XML, data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines" like people, computers, voice machines, 
news feeds, etc.


What is XPath?
XPath is a major element in the XSLT standard.

XPath can be used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document.

XPath is a syntax for defining parts of an XML document
XPath uses path expressions to navigate in XML documents
XPath contains a library of standard functions
XPath is a major element in XSLT and in XQuery
XPath is a W3C recommendation

example: 
short xpath
//*[@id="defaultAction"]
full xpath
/html/body/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[2]/div[3]/p/button

XPath Path Expressions
XPath uses path expressions to select nodes or node-sets in an XML document. These path expressions look very much 
like the expressions you see when you work with a traditional computer file system.

XPath expressions can be used in JavaScript, Java, XML Schema, PHP, Python, C and C++, and lots of other languages.
